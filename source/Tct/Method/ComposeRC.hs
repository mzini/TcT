-- | This processor implements processor \'compose\' specifically for
-- the (weak) dependency pair setting. It tries to estimate the
-- complexity of the input problem based on the complexity of
-- dependency pairs of upper congruence classes (with respect to the
-- congruence graph) relative to the dependency pairs in the remaining
-- lower congruence classes. The overall upper bound for the
-- complexity of the input problem is estimated by multiplication of
-- upper bounds of the sub problems.
-- Note that the processor allows the optional specification of
-- processors that are applied on the two individual subproblems. The
-- transformation results into the systems which could not be oriented
-- by those processors.
