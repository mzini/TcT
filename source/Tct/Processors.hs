-- This module collects available /processors/ of TcT.
-- A processor 'p' is the TcT representation of a complexity techniques
-- that, given a complexity problem, constructs a complete proof for 
-- the problem. 
-- Processors are parameterised in some arguments that control the behaviour
-- of the processor, for instance, the matrix processor is parameterised 
-- in the dimension of the constructed matrix interpretation. 
-- Parameterised processors are called /processor instances/, and 
-- can be obtained using the constructors in "Tct.Instances".
--
-- A list of processors and their synopsis can also be obtained from
-- the command line, using the flag @--list@.

This processor orients the problem using matrix-interpretation over
natural numbers.

[cert :: algebraic|automaton|nothing /(optional)/] This argument specifies restrictions on the matrix-interpretation which induce polynomial growth of
the interpretation of the considered starting terms relative to their size.
Here 'algebraic' refers to simple algebraic restrictions on matrices (in the current implementation,
they are simply restricted to triangular shape, i.e. matrices where coefficients in the lower-left
half below the diagonal are zero. Such matrix-interpretations induce polynomial derivational-complexity.
If 'automaton' is given as argument, then criteria from the theory of weighted automata are used instead
(in the current implementation, the negations of the criteria EDA, and possibly IDA(n), in the case that
the flag 'degree' is set, are used).
If 'nothing' is given, then matrix-interpretations of all function symbols are unrestricted.
Note that matrix interpretations produced with this option do not induce polynomial complexities in general.
The default value is 'automaton'.


[degree :: \<nat>|none /(optional)/] This argument ensures that the complexity induced by the searched matrix interpretation is bounded by a
polynomial of the given degree. Its internal effect is dictated by the value the argument 'cert' is set to.
If it is set to 'algebraic', this restricts the number of non-zero entries in the diagonals of the matrices.
If it is set to 'automaton', this set the paramter 'n' in the criterion 'not IDA(n)'.
Finally, if it is set to 'unrestricted', the effect of setting the 'degree' argument is unspecified.


[dim :: \<nat> /(optional)/] This argument specifies the dimension of the vectors and square-matrices appearing
 in the matrix-interpretation.

Such an upper-bound is necessary as we employ bit-blasting to SAT internally
when searching for compatible matrix interpretations.


[bits :: \<nat>|none /(optional)/] This argument plays the same role as 'bound',
but instead of an upper-bound the number of bits is specified.
This argument overrides the argument 'bound'.


[cbits :: \<nat>|none /(optional)/] This argument specifies the number of bits used for intermediate results, 
as for instance coefficients of matrices obtained by interpreting
left- and right-hand sides.


[uargs :: On|Off /(optional)/] This argument specifies whether usable arguments are computed (if applicable)
in order to relax the monotonicity constraints on the interpretation.

Allowed values are 'stronglylinear', 'linear', 'simple', 'simplemixed', and 'quadratic',
referring to the respective shapes of the abstract polynomials used.
The deault value is 'stronglylinear'.


[bound :: \<nat> /(optional)/] This argument specifies an upper-bound on coefficients appearing in the interpretation.
Such an upper-bound is necessary as we employ bit-blasting to SAT internally
when searching for compatible matrix interpretations.


[bits :: \<nat>|none /(optional)/] This argument plays the same role as 'bound',
but instead of an upper-bound the number of bits is specified.

A problem (A) is subsumed by problem (B) if the complexity of (A) is bounded from above by the complexity of (B).
Currently we only take subset-inclusions of the different components into account.

{- |
This processor implements processor \'decompose\' specifically for
the (weak) dependency pair setting. It tries to estimate the
complexity of the input problem based on the complexity of
dependency pairs of upper congruence classes (with respect to the
congruence graph) relative to the dependency pairs in the remaining
lower congruence classes. The overall upper bound for the
complexity of the input problem is estimated by multiplication of
upper bounds of the sub problems.
Note that the processor allows the optional specification of
processors that are applied on the two individual subproblems. The
transformation results into the systems which could not be oriented
by those processors.

[subprocessor :: \<processor>] The processor that is applied on the transformed problem(s)

[strict :: On|Off /(optional)/] If this flag is set and the transformation fails, this processor aborts.
Otherwise, it applies the subprocessor on the untransformed input.

Otherwise, it applies the subprocessor on the untransformed input.


[parallel :: On|Off /(optional)/] Decides whether the given subprocessor should be applied in parallel.

[checkSubsumed :: On|Off /(optional)/] This flag determines whether the processor should reuse proofs in case that one generated problem subsumes another one.
A problem (A) is subsumed by problem (B) if the complexity of (A) is bounded from above by the complexity of (B).
Currently we only take subset-inclusions of the different components into account.


[on :: trs|any /(optional)/] This flag determine which rules have to be strictly oriented by the the matrix interpretation for
the weight gap principle. Here 'trs' refers to all strict non-dependency-pair rules of the
considered problem, while 'any' only demands any rule at all to be strictly oriented.
The default value is 'trs'.


[cert :: algebraic|automaton|nothing /(optional)/] This argument specifies restrictions on the matrix-interpretation for the weight gap condition which induce polynomial growth of
the interpretation of the considered starting terms relative to their size.
Here 'algebraic' refers to simple algebraic restrictions on matrices (in the current implementation,
they are simply restricted to triangular shape, i.e. matrices where coefficients in the lower-left
half below the diagonal are zero. Such matrix-interpretations induce polynomial derivational-complexity.
If 'automaton' is given as argument, then criteria from the theory of weighted automata are used instead
(in the current implementation, the negations of the criteria EDA, and possibly IDA(n), in the case that
the flag 'degree' is set, are used).
If 'nothing' is given, then matrix-interpretations of all function symbols are unrestricted.
Note that matrix interpretations produced with this option do not induce polynomial complexities in general.
The default value is 'automaton'.


[degree :: \<nat>|none /(optional)/] This argument ensures that the complexity induced by the searched matrix interpretation for the weight gap condition is bounded by a
polynomial of the given degree. Its internal effect is dictated by the value the argument 'cert' is set to.
If it is set to 'algebraic', this restricts the number of non-zero entries in the diagonals of the matrices.
If it is set to 'automaton', this set the paramter 'n' in the criterion 'not IDA(n)'.
Finally, if it is set to 'unrestricted', the effect of setting the 'degree' argument is unspecified.

 in the matrix-interpretation for the weight gap condition.


[bound :: \<nat> /(optional)/] This argument specifies an upper-bound on coefficients appearing in the interpretation.

A problem (A) is subsumed by problem (B) if the complexity of (A) is bounded from above by the complexity of (B).
Currently we only take subset-inclusions of the different components into account.


[split :: dynamic /(optional)/] This argument of type 'Compose.Partitioning' determines strict rules of problem (A). Usually, this should be set to 'Dynamic', in which case the given processor determines selection of rules dynamically.

[allow :: Add|Mult|Compose /(optional)/] This argument type 'Compose.ComposeBound' determines how the complexity certificate should be obtained from subproblems (A) and (B). Consequently, this argument also determines the shape of (B). The third argument defines a processor that is applied on problem (A).

A problem (A) is subsumed by problem (B) if the complexity of (A) is bounded from above by the complexity of (B).
Currently we only take subset-inclusions of the different components into account.
