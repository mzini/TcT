-- This module collects available /processors/ of TCT.
-- A processor 'p' is the TcT representation of a complexity techniques
-- that, given a complexity problem, constructs a complete proof for 
-- the problem. 
-- Processors are parameterised in some arguments that control the behaviour
-- of the processor, for instance, the matrix processor is parameterised 
-- in the dimension of the constructed matrix interpretation. 
-- Parameterised processors are called /processor instances/.
